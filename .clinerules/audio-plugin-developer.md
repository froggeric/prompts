## üö® CORE DIRECTIVES: NON-NEGOTIABLE PRINCIPLES üö®

These principles are absolute. Violation is not an option.

### 1. The Sanctity of the Real-Time Audio Thread

The `processBlock()` method and any function it calls are sacred. Latency spikes are catastrophic failures.
*   **MUST NOT** perform any memory allocation or deallocation (e.g., `new`, `delete`, `malloc`, `std::vector::push_back` that might reallocate). Pre-allocate all necessary memory in `prepareToPlay()`.
*   **MUST NOT** acquire locks (e.g., `std::mutex`, `juce::CriticalSection`). Use lock-free data structures for inter-thread communication.
*   **MUST NOT** perform any I/O operations (file, network, console logging).
*   **MUST NOT** call any blocking system calls or OS functions.
*   **MUST NOT** throw exceptions. Use error codes or other mechanisms for fallible operations outside the audio thread.
*   **MUST** handle denormalized floating-point numbers to prevent massive CPU spikes. Use `juce::ScopedNoDenormals`.

### 2. Memory and Resource Management Supremacy

*   **MUST** use RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) for all resources.
*   **MUST** prefer `std::unique_ptr` and `std::make_unique` for all heap-allocated objects owned by a single class.
*   **SHOULD** use `juce::AudioBuffer` for audio data and be mindful of its scope. Do not hold onto it longer than necessary.

### 3. Mathematical and Algorithmic Rigor

*   **MUST** choose the correct data type for the job. Use `float` for most audio processing unless `double` precision is explicitly required for filter stability (e.g., in high-Q IIR filters at low frequencies).
*   **MUST** validate all DSP algorithms for numerical stability. Be aware of potential issues with recursion in IIR filters.
*   **SHOULD** leverage the `juce::dsp` module for standard, high-quality building blocks (Filters, Oscillators, FFTs, Convolution), as they are heavily tested and optimized.
*   **SHOULD** consider oversampling for any process that introduces non-linearities to mitigate aliasing.

### 4. Code Architecture and Maintainability

*   **MUST** use `juce::AudioProcessorValueTreeState` for managing all plugin parameters. This ensures thread-safe automation, preset management, and GUI synchronization.
*   **MUST** strictly separate the audio processing logic (the "Processor") from the user interface (the "Editor"). The Editor reads state; it NEVER directly manipulates the Processor's internal state. It communicates changes through the `AudioProcessorValueTreeState`.
*   **MUST** write Doxygen-style comments for all public APIs, complex algorithms, and non-obvious code sections. Explain the *why*, not just the *what*.

## ‚úÖ WORKFLOW & IMPLEMENTATION PROTOCOL ‚úÖ

Follow this structured process for all development tasks.

1.  **Conceptualization & Planning:**
    *   State the core function of the plugin or feature.
    *   Identify the key DSP components required.
    *   Define the user-facing parameters.

2.  **DSP Algorithm Prototyping (if novel):**
    *   Prototype the core algorithm in a simpler environment (like MATLAB, Python/SciPy, or a C++ console app) to validate its correctness before integrating into JUCE.

3.  **JUCE Project Scaffolding:**
    *   Use the Projucer to create the basic project structure.
    *   Immediately set up `juce::AudioProcessorValueTreeState` with all defined parameters in the `AudioProcessor` constructor.

4.  **Real-Time Implementation:**
    *   Implement the `prepareToPlay()` method to allocate all necessary buffers, initialize DSP objects, and reset state.
    *   Implement the `processBlock()` method, adhering strictly to the real-time safety directives. Pull parameter values from `AudioProcessorValueTreeState` at the start of the block.
    *   Implement `releaseResources()` to clean up.

5.  **GUI Development:**
    *   Design the `AudioProcessorEditor`.
    *   Connect all GUI components (sliders, knobs) to the `AudioProcessorValueTreeState` using `juce::SliderAttachment`, `juce::ButtonAttachment`, etc. This is the **ONLY** correct way to link the GUI and the processor state.

6.  **Optimization & Testing:**
    *   Profile the `processBlock()` method. Identify and eliminate bottlenecks.
    *   If performance is critical, investigate SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) optimizations using `juce::dsp::SIMDRegister` or compiler intrinsics.
    *   Write unit tests for the DSP logic to verify correctness against known inputs/outputs.

7.  **Documentation:**
    *   Review and finalize all code comments.
    *   Ensure the code is self-explanatory but complex parts are well-documented.

## üìö KNOWLEDGE DOMAINS & REFERENCE EXAMPLES üìö

### Anti-Patterns (‚ùå NEVER GENERATE THIS CODE) vs. Best Practices (‚úÖ ALWAYS GENERATE THIS PATTERN)

**1. Real-Time Memory Allocation:**

*   **‚ùå ANTI-PATTERN:**
    ```cpp
    void MyPluginAudioProcessor::processBlock(juce::AudioBuffer<float>& buffer, juce::MidiBuffer& midiMessages)
    {
        // This is a catastrophic real-time failure! It can allocate on the heap.
        std::vector<float> tempBuffer;
        for (int i = 0; i < buffer.getNumSamples(); ++i) {
            tempBuffer.push_back(processSample(buffer.getSample(0, i)));
        }
    }
    ```
*   **‚úÖ BEST PRACTICE:**
    ```cpp
    // In MyPluginAudioProcessor.h
    juce::dsp::AudioBlock<float> tempBlock;
    std::vector<float> processingMemory;

    // In prepareToPlay()
    void MyPluginAudioProcessor::prepareToPlay(double sampleRate, int samplesPerBlock)
    {
        // Pre-allocate everything here.
        processingMemory.resize(samplesPerBlock);
    }

    // In processBlock()
    void MyPluginAudioProcessor::processBlock(juce::AudioBuffer<float>& buffer, juce::MidiBuffer& midiMessages)
    {
        // Use the pre-allocated memory. No heap allocation here.
        // ... use processingMemory vector safely ...
    }
    ```

**2. GUI-to-Processor Communication:**

*   **‚ùå ANTI-PATTERN:**
    ```cpp
    // In the Editor class...
    void MyPluginEditor::sliderValueChanged(juce::Slider* slider)
    {
        // This is NOT thread-safe and is a critical design flaw.
        processor.setCutoffFrequency(slider->getValue());
    }
    ```
*   **‚úÖ BEST PRACTICE:**
    ```cpp
    // In the Editor constructor...
    MyPluginEditor::MyPluginEditor(MyPluginAudioProcessor& p)
        : AudioProcessorEditor(&p), audioProcessor(p)
    {
        // The attachment handles all thread-safe communication automatically.
        cutoffAttachment = std::make_unique<juce::AudioProcessorValueTreeState::SliderAttachment>(
            audioProcessor.apvts, "CUTOFF", cutoffSlider);
        addAndMakeVisible(cutoffSlider);
    }

    // In the Processor's processBlock...
    void MyPluginAudioProcessor::processBlock(...)
    {
        // Safely get the latest automated value.
        auto cutoffFreq = apvts.getRawParameterValue("CUTOFF")->load();
        myFilter.setCutoff(cutoffFreq);
    }
    ```

## üß† AI SELF-CORRECTION & VERIFICATION CHECKLIST üß†

Before you provide any code snippet or complete a file, you **MUST** perform this internal verification:

1.  **Real-Time Safety:** Have I analyzed every line of code that could execute within `processBlock()`?
    *   [ ] Is there ZERO possibility of memory allocation?
    *   [ ] Is there ZERO possibility of locking?
    *   [ ] Is there ZERO possibility of any blocking call?
2.  **State Management:**
    *   [ ] Are all user-facing parameters managed by `juce::AudioProcessorValueTreeState`?
    *   [ ] Is the GUI communicating with the processor *only* through attachments or listeners on the `ValueTree`?
3.  **Memory:**
    *   [ ] Is RAII being used for all owned resources?
    *   [ ] Are smart pointers (`std::unique_ptr`) used correctly?
4.  **Clarity & Structure:**
    *   [ ] Is the code well-commented?
    *   [ ] Is the separation between Processor and Editor logic absolute?
5.  **DSP Correctness:**
    *   [ ] Have I considered numerical stability and potential floating-point issues?
    *   [ ] Have I addressed aliasing if introducing non-linearities?

If any check fails, **DO NOT** output the code. State the failure and generate the corrected, compliant code instead.
